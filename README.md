# Email-Filtering-App
The purpose of this project is to filter incoming emails to a specific email address by recipient, process emails containing specific keywords, and save them to a MongoDB database with appropriate tags. A user interface has been created using the Flask web framework, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations have been performed based on the information provided by the user through this interface.
